# Risk analysis and risk treatment

## Risk definition

The parameters for the risk matrix are defined in the **Risk definition** section. To do this, navigate to **Risk definitions** in the menu and then **DSRA**. Here you can edit the categories by **clicking on the pencil icon**. The following parameters can be modified individually:

- Impact of damage: Name and definition of the categories
- Probability of occurrence: Name and definition of the categories
- Risk categories: Name, definition and color of the categories

## Risk analysis

It is possible to carry out a risk analysis for all scope and process objects. To do this, please proceed as follows:

- Select the **Risks** tab for the object concerned, e.g. processing activity in the object environment.
- You can now add a **Risk** for your processing activity using the red **Plus icon**.

- Make a suitable selection from the data protection risks.

![Hazards](  /assets/en/domain-ds-gvo/Bild25.png)

The list contains the threats manually applied to your unit from the catalog. You also have the option of creating your own individual hazards as objects using the **Hazards** form in order to use them for your risk analysis.

## Risk assessment

To edit the individual data protection risks, click on the corresponding risk. A specific risk assessment can be carried out in the risk dialog that opens. To do this, evaluate the following parameters:

- **Probability of occurrence** and, if applicable, an explanation.
- Damage impact** per protection target and an explanation if necessary.

After you have saved your entries, the **gross risk** is automatically calculated from these two values using the risk matrix.

## Risk treatment

The familiar risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk transfer and risk acceptance options are available for risk treatment, each with a text field for explanations.

If the **Risk reduction** risk treatment option is selected, the risk can be reduced by adding **mitigating measures**. verinice offers you two options for storing **mitigating measures**:

### Create mitigating measure

To create a **new measure**, click **Add mitigating measure** and then **Create mitigating measure**. A dialog opens to create the new measure. After you have saved your data for the measure, the new measure is displayed in the previous risk dialog in the **Risk reduction measures** area.

### Link mitigating measure

You can also add mitigating measures by linking them to **existing measures**. To do this, click **Add mitigating measures** and then **Link mitigating measure**. In the dialog that opens, you can make a selection from measures already entered for mitigation. After **Saving**, the measures you have selected are listed in the **Risk reduction measures** area.

Finally, the net risk and, if applicable, an explanation must be set manually. Please remember to save and close the risk dialog.

## Edit mitigating measures

To be able to edit **mitigating measures**, navigate to the Risks tab in the object environment of the target object concerned. The risks identified in advance are displayed here. The **Display implementation** function takes you to an overview of all mitigating measures for the selected risk.

Here you can now edit each individual measure by clicking on the respective measure. The following information can be viewed or entered in the implementation dialog that opens:

- Information on target object and TOM
- Description of requirements
- Information on the implementation:
- Person responsible
- Implementation by (date)
- Implementation status (Unprocessed, Yes, Partially, No, Not required)
- Description of implementation

After you have entered the data, close the dialog with **Save**.
