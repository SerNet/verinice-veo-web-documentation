# Data protection incidents

verinice supports you in recording and documenting data protection incidents. You can create a new data protection incident using the *Data protection incident form* via the two tried-and-tested methods - dashboard and/or main menu.
In addition to general information on the facts of the case, further data protection-relevant information can be recorded in the sections provided for this purpose.
Furthermore, affected target objects, identified data protection risks and planned and implemented countermeasures are included in the documentation and evaluation process. All information can then be output via the *Data protection incident report form* and used for reporting to the supervisory authorities if necessary.
