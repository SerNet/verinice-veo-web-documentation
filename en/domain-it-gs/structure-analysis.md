# Structural Analysis

With the structural analysis, you model the infrastructure of your institution as the foundation for creating an IT security concept according to the basic, standard, or core protection approach.

## Institution

Record your institution by navigating via the dashboard or menu to the object type **Scope** with the subtype **Institutions**. Create a new institution using the red plus button **Create Institution** in the bottom right:

:::info  
You can always create objects contextually using the plus button with the currently active object and subtype!  
:::

Click **Save** once you have entered all the desired data for the institution. Please note that the fields **Name** and **Status** (in all objects) are mandatory! Your institution will then be listed in the object overview.

## Information Network

Next, navigate to the object type **Scope** and the subtype **Information Networks** and, similar to the institution, create your first **Information Network**:

Enter all the required information in the form (e.g., abbreviation, name, description/scope, protection approach) and save the object.

Depending on your needs, you can create as many (sub)information networks as necessary.

## Target Objects

To develop an IT security concept, it's necessary to analyze and document the existing infrastructure. All target object types required for modeling the infrastructure are documented under **Processes** and **Assets**. Create new target objects, such as business processes or IT systems.  
The result of the structural analysis is the complete mapping of the infrastructure:

## Dependencies Between Target Objects

Links (dependencies/relations) between objects are a fundamental element that effectively supports the implementation of various tasks within an ISMS. In principle, any objects can be linked with one another. Several predefined link types exist by default, some of which are essential for specific functions.

To create a link between two target objects, you need to add the required object within the form of another object.  
Scroll down in the form to the section where required objects are listed and select the necessary object.  
If the desired object has not yet been created, you can create a new one directly from within the form by clicking **+ Create "desired object"**.

In the object environment under **Links**, all incoming and outgoing connections are listed.  
Naturally, you can navigate to the corresponding target object by clicking on it to continue editing.
