# IT-Grundschutz Check

In this step, the status of the modeled modules—specifically, the individual requirements—must be processed. To edit requirements, click **Show Implementation** for the respective module in the **Modules** tab of the target object's context.

You will be taken to an overview of all requirements of the selected module. Here, you can edit the individual requirements. By clicking on a requirement, the implementation dialog opens, where you can view or enter the following information:

- Information about the target object and requirement.
- Requirement description (from the IT-Grundschutz Compendium).
- Implementation information:
  - Responsible person
  - Implementation deadline (date)
  - Implementation status (Unprocessed, Yes, Partially, No, Not Required)
  - Implementation description

Once you have entered the data, close the dialog by clicking **Save**.

In practice, this step is more time-consuming, as a large number of requirements are often in the process of being implemented. After all modeled modules and requirements have been processed, the result of the IT-Grundschutz Check can be generated as a report.
