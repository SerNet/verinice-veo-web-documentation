### Performance improvement

The **deletion of very large units** has been accelerated to such an extent that timeouts are no longer to be expected. In a few cases there were timeouts so far. (However, the units were deleted after 1-2 minutes and were then no longer displayed after a browser reload).

### Detailed improvements and bug fixes
