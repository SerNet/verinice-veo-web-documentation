The following new features are available to users with the release of verinice 41!

## General functions

**Status: Productive**

### Adjustment of risk matrices

In the **Risk Definition**, the **Probability of Occurrence**, **Impact**, and **Risk Categories** can now be adjusted. The changes are made in a wizard and are validated against the backend before being saved to avoid inconsistent risk definitions.

In the **verinice2BI connector**, you can now evaluate applied controls and modeled building blocks as well as the implementation status.

### Product maintenance

The OpenAPI documentation has been improved to make using the REST API easier.

## Domain ISO 27001 (DE)

**Status: Productive**

To better distinguish between individual standards in different languages, the name of the domain **ISO 27001 (DE)** has been specified.
