### Detail improvements and bug fixes

- The shortcuts for showing/hiding object details and forms have been added to the dialog for the overview of available shortcuts.
- If no units have been created yet, you no longer end up in an empty unit management screen, but are offered the two actions **Create unit** and **First steps**.
- The 404 error page displayed after logging in following a domain updating/changing has been fixed - you are now redirected to the unit management.
- Units with double/multiple spaces can now be deleted in the unit management.
- After editing an object and returning to the object overview, you now land on the original pagination page and not, as before, always on the first page.
- The headings in the object selection dialog have been corrected.
- The incorrect success message when editing mitigating measures incorrectly has been fixed.
- When creating a new risk category, you can now navigate to the summary in the wizard.
- Transparent colors are no longer supported in the color picker of the risk definition so that the colors are displayed correctly in the reports.
- Links are now recognizable as such in the breadcrumbs.
- When opening an object in a new browser tab using CTRL-mouse click, only one new browser tab is opened.
- In dark mode, the display of some invisible elements in the tutorials has been corrected.
