# verinice 36
The following new features are available to users with the release of verinice 36:

## General functions

**Status: Productive**

### Detailed improvements

- The object type **Measures** has been renamed to the generally valid and more comprehensible term **Controls**.
- In a domain, you can configure which **Scope**, **Process** or **Asset** subtypes.

- Correction of the prematurely displayed confirmation dialog when creating a new object.
- Fixed an error when saving translations (singular/plural) in the form schema editor.
- Typescript error in the frontend fixed.

### Product maintenance

- Improvement of the deployment process after changes to domains.
