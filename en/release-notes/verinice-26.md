### Improved unit management

- By switching unit management from tables to lists (cards), the content of units is displayed more transparently - it is possible to see at a glance which domains are assigned to the unit.
- New units are created in a wizard that simplifies the assignment of domains and the application of profiles.
- The editing of units is more intuitive, especially with regard to the assignment of domains and the application of profiles.

### Adaptation of the version scheme
- With **verinice 26** the versioning scheme is adapted from **1.21** to **26**! 

### Detailed improvements and bug fixes

- Risk mitigating measures can be deleted.
- The icon for risk treatment is displayed again in the Risks tab in the object view.
- Incorrect time information in reports has been fixed by taking the time zone into account.
- Multi-domain-capable history - when restoring objects, only the information that can be edited in the respective domain is restored.
