# BCM action plan and continuous improvement

As part of the Act phase of the PDCA cycle, continuous improvement of the BCMS must be ensured.
To this end, identified corrective measures and potential improvements must be systematically documented, evaluated, and tracked.
In verinice, new measures can be created or existing measures can be viewed and managed under the Control subtype Corrective and Improvement Measures.

To control the implementation of the measures, they must be applied under the Scope BCMS scope in the **Control** tab. The measures can then be tracked via **Show implementation**.

In the future, it will be possible to generate a BCM action plan via report, which clearly summarizes all ongoing corrective and improvement measures.
Continuous maintenance and monitoring of this action plan increases the effectiveness of the BCMS and ensures sustainable organizational resilience.
