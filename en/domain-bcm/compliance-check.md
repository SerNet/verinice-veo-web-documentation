# Performance review, compliance, and supply chain management

Structured performance and compliance reviews and the involvement of critical service providers strengthen the **resilience of the entire supply chain** and ensure the **continuous improvement** of the BCMS.

To ensure the effectiveness of the BCMS, regular **performance reviews** and **compliance checks** must be carried out. The aim is to ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and normative requirements (e.g., ISO 22301, BSI Standard 200-4).

The following procedures can be used in verinice for this purpose:
- Creation of **own requirement catalogs**,
- Use of **standard catalogs** (e.g., BCM requirement catalog of the BSI),
- Definition of **internal BCM basic requirements**.

## Review/evaluation of a BCMS

Self-assessments and documentation of the results can be carried out in verinice using the **Control tab** of a scope, e.g., the BCMS scope. There, the corresponding requirement catalogs can be applied and the implementation of the requirements can be managed via **Show implementation**.

## Review of critical service providers and supply chains

**Outsourced processes** and **external service providers** are also part of the BCMS and must be included in the **performance review**. For this purpose, individual basic requirement catalogs should be created for time-critical service providers.

Once created, this catalog, including requirements, can be applied in the scope object of the external service provider and compliance can be checked via the **Compliance Tab Control**.

In the future, the results can be evaluated in a corresponding report and summarized in a tabular overview.
