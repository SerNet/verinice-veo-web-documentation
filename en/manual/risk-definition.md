# Risk definitions

The definitions for the risk analysis can be viewed in the Risk definitions section.
The risk definition shows a probability of occurrence/impact matrix for various protection goals:

1. a probability of occurrence/impact matrix is shown for each protection objective (here confidentiality).
1. the impact can be adjusted for each protection objective.
1 The Y-axis shows the impact levels.
1. the X-axis shows the levels for the probability of occurrence.
1. the assignment of the risk categories is color-coded in the matrix. Move the mouse over individual fields to display the detailed definitions for the individual parameters.

6. the risk categories are defined across all protection goals.
7 The probability of occurrence is defined across all protection goals.
8. if no risk matrix is to be used for a protection goal, this can be omitted.
9. optionally, a risk matrix can then be used to consider the level of damage.

You can currently adapt the names and descriptions for all parameters to your organization.
