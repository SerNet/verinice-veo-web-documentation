# Catalogs

![Catalogs](  /assets/en/manual/catalogs.de.png)

1. Depending on the domain, catalogs provide global objects for use.  
   These may include, for example, data protection threats, technical and organizational measures (TOM), or IT-Grundschutz modules.
2. You can also **search** within catalog objects. In catalogs, the search is performed by default on the object name, since catalog objects do not have a designator!
3. Select the desired objects.
4. When applied, the selected objects are copied into your active unit and can be used there.
