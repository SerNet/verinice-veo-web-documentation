# Unit management

In the **Unit administration** you can create new units and edit or delete existing units. All functions use parts of the wizard already known from the **First steps**:

1. you can access the unit management at any time via the **verinice logo**,
2. or select **Manage units** in the unit selector.
3. note the number  of **available units**! There are always two units available, e.g. to use one unit for productive work and one as a test unit. If all available units are in use, you can only create further units if you have deleted units or purchased additional units.
4. edit the name and description of a unit using the **pencil icon**.
5. delete units that are no longer required by clicking on the **basket icon** after a confirmation prompt - you must confirm the name of the unit to be deleted. It is recommended to create a local backup in advance via [data transfer](data-transfer).

6.  create new **units** via the button of the same name in the already known wizard.
7. you can apply (further) [profiles](/object-model/profiles.md) to your unit. Please note that a profile always creates a number of additional objects and may also assign a new domain. This process cannot currently be undone!
8 Similarly, you can add further [domains](/object-model/domains.md) to your unit, e.g. to map an ISMS according to ISO 27001 and a TISAX/VDA ISA assessment with the same objects.
