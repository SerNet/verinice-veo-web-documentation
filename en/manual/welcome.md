# First steps

After logging in for the first time, you will be taken to the **First steps** page, where a wizard will help you with the initial **creation of a unit**:
![First steps](  /assets/en/manual/welcome.de.png)

1. create a [unit](/object-model/objects#unit) in which you map your organization or institution:
![Unit name and description](  /assets/en/manual/unit_name.de.png)
2. optionally select a [profile](/object-model/profiles.md), which creates objects in your new unit as a template. Profiles are specific to (at least) one domain, e.g. **Sample data** for the GDPR domain, an **IT-Grundschutz profile** for the IT-Grundschutz domain or the **Risk catalog** for the ISO domain. You can add (further) **profiles** to your unit at any time via the [unit management](unit-management) and start with an empty unit.

3. specify which [domains](/object-model/domains.md) you want to work with in your unit. At least one domain must be selected! You can add further domains to your unit at any time via the [unit management](unit-management):
![Select domain(s)](  /assets/en/manual/unit_domain.de.png)
4. if the selected details are correct, confirm the creation of your first unit:
![Summary](  /assets/en/manual/unit_summary.de.png)
Once the unit has been successfully created, you will be redirected to the [Dashboard](user-interface#dashboard) of the unit.
The **First steps** page summarizes further sources of information; you can call up the page again at any time using the **Account button**.
