# Profile in the ISO/IEC 27000 Domain

## Working with Risk Profile according to DIN ISO/IEC 27001

A **profile** is a predefined set of example objects and already-applied catalog elements based on a specific **catalog**. It simplifies the setup and configuration of a Unit, as many required objects and relationships are already included. Unlike a catalog, a profile can represent relationships between objects.

Using a profile, you can load a complete example organization or a risk profile based on **DIN ISO/IEC 27001** and apply it to your Unit – including associated scopes, assets, processes, threats, people, vulnerabilities, and security controls.

## Benefits of the Risk Profile according to DIN ISO/IEC 27001

Profiles offer the following benefits:

- **Quick start:** You get a structured starting point for your ISMS.
- **Time savings:** Many elements are already preconfigured – no manual creation needed.
- **Standards compliance:** The contents follow recognized standards like ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27005.
- **Simplified editing:** The profiles include typical objects, relationships, and controls that can be directly adapted to your organization.
- **Efficient risk analysis:** Based on threats and vulnerabilities according to **ISO/IEC 27005**, many scenarios are predefined. These serve as potential risks and are already linked to typical **assets**. In addition, appropriate risk-mitigating measures from **Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001** are assigned, significantly reducing the effort for risk identification and assessment.

## Contents of the ISO/IEC 27001 Profile

The ISO/IEC 27001 profile provides example objects from the following areas:

- Organizational structure  
- ISMS scope & scopes  
- External service providers  
- Business processes  
- Assets  
- People  
- Information security incidents  
- Documents & records  
- Controls: Security measures and requirements from DIN ISO/IEC 27001  
- Scenarios: Threats and vulnerabilities according to ISO/IEC 27005  

## Applying a Risk Profile according to DIN ISO/IEC 27001

A profile can be applied in two scenarios:

1. **When creating a new Unit:** During the creation process, you can select a profile that is directly applied to the new Unit. To do so, navigate to the top left menu and click the **Select Unit** drop-down, scroll to the bottom, and choose **Manage Units**. Then click the **Create Unit** button in the lower right and in the second step of the wizard, select the option to apply the Risk Profile according to DIN ISO/IEC 27001:

2.**Subsequently for existing Units:** Even after a Unit has been created, the risk profile according to DIN ISO/IEC 27001 can be applied retroactively. To access Unit management again, you can alternatively click on the **verinice** logo. For the corresponding Unit, click the **Apply Profile** button to apply the profile to an existing Unit:

## Note

Applying a profile **does not overwrite** existing data. New objects will be added, and existing structures remain unchanged.

Please note:

- The **scopes**, **business processes**, **assets**, **people**, and **information security incidents** included in the profile are **example data** intended as templates. These should be individually adapted to the conditions of your organization after applying the profile.

- The **controls** included represent the requirements of **DIN ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A)**. They are not examples, but normative requirements that must be appropriately considered and implemented within your ISMS to achieve compliance with the standard.

- The included **threats and vulnerabilities** are taken from **ISO/IEC 27005**. Based on this, **example scenarios** were modeled and linked to relevant assets and security measures. These scenarios serve as a starting point for risk analysis and can be adapted and further developed according to your specific conditions as part of the risk management process.
