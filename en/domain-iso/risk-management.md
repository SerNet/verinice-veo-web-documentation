# Risk Management

## Risk Definition

In the **Risk Definition** section, the parameters for the risk matrix are defined. To do this, navigate to **Risk Definitions** in the menu and then to **ISORA**. Here you can modify the name, definition, and color of the parameters for impact, likelihood, and risk category by **clicking the pencil icon**.

## Risk Analysis

It is possible to perform a risk analysis for all scope, asset, and process objects. To do so, proceed as follows:

- For the relevant object (e.g., assets), select the **Risks** tab in the object view.
- Use the red **plus icon** to add a **risk** for your asset.

- Choose an appropriate scenario.

![Select Risk]( /assets/en/domain-iso/verinice-39-select-risk.de.png)

The listed scenarios come from the catalog that was manually applied to your Unit. You can also create your own individual scenarios as objects using the **Scenarios** form, to use them in your risk analysis.

## Risk Evaluation

To edit a single risk, click on the respective risk. In the **Risk Dialog** that opens, you can perform a specific risk assessment. Evaluate the following parameters:

- **Likelihood** (and optionally an explanation)  
- **Impact** per protection goal (and optionally an explanation)  

After saving your entries, the **inherent risk** is calculated based on the risk matrix.

## Risk Treatment

The following options are available for risk treatment:

- Risk Avoidance  
- Risk Reduction  
- Risk Transfer  
- Risk Acceptance  

Each is provided with a text field for additional explanation.

If **Risk Reduction** is selected, the risk can be reduced by adding **Mitigating Controls**.

verinice offers two ways to document **Mitigating Controls**:

### Create a Mitigating Control

To create a new **control**, click **Add Mitigating Controls** and then **Create Mitigating Control**. A dialog opens to enter data for the new control. After saving the control, it will appear in the previous Risk Dialog under **Controls for Risk Reduction**.

### Link a Mitigating Control

You can also add **Mitigating Controls** by linking to **existing controls**. These existing security controls may come from the catalog (by applying relevant measures) or be custom-defined controls created using the **Security Controls** form.

Using the **Add Mitigating Controls** function and then **Link Mitigating Controls**, you can choose from previously documented controls for mitigation. Once saved, the selected controls will be listed in the **Controls for Risk Reduction** section.

Finally, the net risk and a justification must be set. Please remember to save and close the Risk Dialog.

::: info A control group is always created in the background for the controls assigned to a risk.

## Editing Mitigating Controls

To edit **Mitigating Controls**, navigate to the **Risks** tab of the affected target object. All previously identified risks are listed here. Use the **Show Implementation** function to access an overview of all mitigating controls for the selected risk.

![Control List Overview]( /assets/en/domain-iso/verinice-39-control-list.de.png)

Here you can edit each individual control by clicking on it. In the implementation dialog that opens, the following information can be viewed or entered:

- Information about the target object  
- Details about the security control, such as control description, control type, etc.  
- Implementation information:
  - Responsible person  
  - Implementation deadline (date)  
  - Implementation status (Not started, Yes, Partially, No, Not required)  
  - Implementation description  

![Edit Control]( /assets/en/domain-iso/verinice-39-control-implementation.de.png)

After entering the data, close the dialog with **Save**.
