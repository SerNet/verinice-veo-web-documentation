# Structure of the ISO 27000 domain

## Object and subtypes

### Scope objects

- **Organizations:** To map the organization with the most important master data.
- **ISMS scopes:** ISMS scopes for defining which areas of a company are affected by the implementation and application of the ISMS.
- **External service providers:** Are considered separately as external institutions or organizations in order to map the special outsourcing requirements.
- **Scopes (general):** To map other objects of consideration, such as projects or interest groups.

### Process objects

- **Business processes:** To document the core processes and other supporting processes.

### Asset objects

- **Assets:** Information assets that are taken into account in the ISMS.

### Person objects

- **Persons:** Persons (groups) or roles.

### Incident objects

- **Information security incidents:** For the documentation of incidents/occurrences.

### Document objects

- **Documents:** For recording and linking documents.
- **Records:** Storage of documents to be used as evidence.

### Control objects

- **Requirements:** Requirements of DIN ISO/IEC 27001:2024 from the management framework.
- **Security measures:** Security measures from Annex A of DIN ISO/IEC 27001:2024.
- **Control groups:** All mitigating measures for a risk object.

### Scenarios

- **Scenarios:** Scenarios for use in the risk analysis.

## Catalog

In addition to scenarios based on threats and vulnerabilities of ISO/IEC 27005:2022, the catalog also provides requirements of DIN ISO/IEC 27001:2024 from the management framework and security measures from Appendix A. Sample objects for documents and records are also included.

## Profiles

The profile **Risk profile according to DIN ISO/IEC 27001** provides an organization with sample objects for mapping an ISMS according to DIN ISO/IEC 27001 including a prepared risk analysis. Scenarios based on threats and vulnerabilities of ISO/IEC 27005:2022 are linked to relevant example assets and the management requirements as well as the Annex A requirements of DIN ISO/IEC 27001:2024 for risk treatment are taken into account.

## Reports

The ISO 27000 domain provides the following reports

- **Statement of applicability:** Lists all security measures from Annex A of DIN ISO/IEC 27001 and describes whether they are applied, excluded or partially implemented as well as a statement of applicability or non-applicability.

- **Inventory:** An overview of all relevant assets.

## Risk definition

The standard risk definition **ISO risk analysis** (ISORA) contains the protection objectives of confidentiality, integrity and availability.
