# Object model

- verinice represents information in different [domains](./domains), e.g. for an ISMS according to ISO 27000 or a DSMS according to the GDPR.
- verinice supports the development and operation of management systems for information security and data protection. The object model defines [objects](./objects) for this purpose, which can be used simultaneously for the various management systems. There is a model with which all procedures and standards can be mapped.
- Objects are represented in specific [forms](./forms) depending on the subtype.
- [Catalogs](./catalogs) provide system-wide objects for use/application.
- [Profiles](./profiles) provide templates or demo data that significantly simplify work in verinice.
