# Domains

The various specialist areas that can be processed with the verinice management system are called *domains*. At the moment, it is planned that five domains will be included in verinice:

* DS-GVO
* IT baseline protection
* NIS2
* TISAX
* ISO&nbsp;27000
![domains]( /assets/en/object-model/domains.png)
These domains can be used individually or combined. For example, users can start with the GDPR domain and create a record of processing activities there.

Later, it is possible to use the same objects that were created for this in the IT-Grundschutz domain. Domains can also be copied and extended. You can create your own domains, which may be derived from the existing ones.

## Domain contents

A domain defines subtypes, aspects, links, forms, a catalog, profiles and, if applicable, risk definitions:
![domain]( /assets/en/object-model/domain-bestandteile-kompakt.png)

* A [subject object](objects#subject-objects) has a specific [subtype](#subtypes) for each domain.
* A domain object contains several [aspects](#aspects). An aspect is a group of domain-specific attributes.
* [Links](#links) are relationships between two objects.
* A [form](#forms) can be used to record exactly the data that is required for a specific use case from a domain.
* A [catalog](#catalog) is a collection of ready-made technical objects that can be applied to an ISMS model.
* [Profiles](#profile) are collections of ready-made technical objects that have been modeled for a specific use case.

* [Risk definition](#risk definitions) are configurations of the risk analysis.

### Subtypes

The specific types of specialized objects in a domain are mapped via the subtypes. A domain defines a set of subtypes for each of the eight [object types](objects#subject objects). It is also possible for a domain not to define any subtypes for an object type if this object type is irrelevant for the domain.
A subtype from a domain must be assigned to a specific specialist object so that it can be used in the domain at all. The subtype of a functional object controls, among other things, which [forms](#forms) it is processed with and which other functional objects it may be linked to (see [links](#links)).
::: info Example
A [process](objects#process) is to be created in the GDPR. To do this, one of the subtypes *processing activity*, *data transfer* and *data protection impact assessment* defined there must be selected. The process is created as a *processing activity*. It is then additionally associated with ISO&nbsp;27000, whereby the subtype *business process* is selected. The process is now a processing activity in the context of the GDPR and a business process according to ISO 27000.

### Aspects

In addition to basic properties such as name, description or abbreviation, a specialized object can also have domain-specific aspects. An aspect contains several attributes of a specialized object that are generally only valid in one domain. However, there are also shared aspects that are valid in several domains.
A domain defines its available aspects together with attributes; each attribute has a name and a data type. If an aspect is defined identically in several domains, the aspect is considered to be shared. For a specialized object, the attributes of a shared aspect appear in all corresponding domains and the values are the same everywhere.
::: info Example
A process from the GDPR contains an aspect with the data protection-relevant attributes *Type of data transmitted*, *Data subject* and *Legal basis*. At the same time, however, the same process can be a business process in the ISO&nbsp;27000 domain and therefore contain an aspect from the ISO&nbsp;27000 domain with the attributes *Confidentiality*, *Integrity* and *Availability*.

### Links

A link establishes a domain-specific relationship to another specialized object. In addition to the linked object, a link also contains attributes that belong to the link.
In addition to the link name and a series of attributes, the permitted [subtype](#subtypen) for the link target is also defined for each link in the domain.
::: info Example
In a fictitious domain, controls are to be assigned to persons who are responsible for the control in a specific time period. For this purpose, a link *Responsible* is defined in the domain, which links controls to persons and contains the attributes *From* and *To*, with which the time period can be recorded. A specific control can have several *responsible* links to different persons, whereby each link has its own values for the attributes *from* and *to*.
![links]( /assets/en/object-model/links.png)
:::

### Forms

A domain contains any number of forms. These forms can be used specifically to edit the aspects and links in the objects contained in the domain and help users to implement the workflows required in the domain. The forms are only visible to users who work with the domain. Users can define new forms in the domain or modify and adapt existing ones. The article [Forms](forms) describes the forms in verinice.

### Catalog

The catalog is the set of all catalog elements in a domain. A catalog element serves as a template for a [subject object](/object-model/objects.html#subject-objects). In order to be able to work with a catalog element in a [unit](/object-model/objects.html#unit), it must first be applied to the unit, i.e. its contents are copied to the target unit as a specialist object.
A catalog element can have almost all the properties and relationships that a specialist object can have, such as a name, a description or [parts](/object-model/objects.html#composite). When a catalog element is applied, a new specialist object is created in the target unit and the properties and relationships of the catalog element are transferred to the specialist object. If the catalog element has relationships to other catalog elements, the referenced catalog elements are also applied to the unit. The types of relationships that are taken into account can be configured in the domain.
::: info Example
The [Domain IT-Grundschutz](/domain-it-gs/) contains various [Controls](/object-model/objects.html#control) with the subtypes building block layer, building block & requirement as catalog elements. The controls are arranged hierarchically. For example, the _9 NET.1.2 Network Management_ module contains several requirements as [parts](/object-model/objects.html#composite) and is itself a part of the _9 NET Networks and Communication_ module layer. If the _9 NET.1.2 Network management_ module is applied to an empty unit, the module itself is copied to the unit as a specialized object, as are all its requirements. However, the entire building block layer _9 NET Networks and Communication_ is not copied, because the IT-Grundschutz domain is configured so that only parts of catalog elements are automatically applied, but not higher-level composites.
:::
A subject object that was created from a catalog element is a copy that remains permanently linked to the catalog element. This enables both the individual adaptability of the object and the comparison with the catalog content in the further life cycle of the object. The link between the specialist object and the catalog element can also prevent a catalog element from being accidentally applied to the same unit more than once.

### Profiles

A profile is a collection of specialist objects that have been modeled for a specific use case. Many of the specialist objects in the profiles come from the catalog in the domain. In the profiles, the entries from the catalog are used multiple times in different scenarios. Profiles therefore contain ready-made ISMS models that can be used as templates. They contain instructions and examples for the practical use of verinice.

### Risk definitions

A risk definition is the configuration of the risk analysis in a domain. The parameters for calculating the risk can be customized in the risk definition.
It is possible for several risk definitions to be stored in a domain so that a different risk definition can be used depending on the [Scope](objects#scope). It is also possible for a domain to contain no risk definitions at all if the recording of [risks](objects#risk) is not intended in the domain.

### Inspection

An **inspection** is a check or validation of a specialized object. It is used to ensure that certain conditions or criteria are met. Inspections are linked to a severity level and a description. They are saved and managed to ensure a consistent assessment of the functional objects.  
An inspection is displayed to users in order to offer corrections or comments for individual subject objects. It can also contain **suggestions**(*“quick fixes ”*) to rectify the identified deviation directly.  
An **inspection** can use decisions to arrive at its assessment. For example, a decision can determine whether a DPIA is required, and the inspection uses this result to provide the user with a corresponding recommendation or correction option.
:::info Example
In data protection, an inspection could determine that a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) is mandatory but has not yet been carried out. The inspection can then directly offer the action of adding the DPIA.  
:::

### Decision

A **Decision** evaluates a technical object using a list of **Rules** (see below) to determine a Boolean result value. The first applicable rule determines the result (first-hit policy). Decisions are used to carry out a systematic and comprehensible evaluation on the basis of several rules.  
A decision shows the user the final result of the evaluation.  
:::info Example
A decision could determine whether a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) is required for a specialist object. It shows exactly which **rule** was responsible for this decision and how it was evaluated. This enables transparent traceability of the decision-making process.
:::

#### Rule

A **rule** is a configurable condition that is applied to a functional object to determine whether it fulfills certain criteria. Rules are part of a decision and provide an initial value that becomes the result of the decision if the rule applies. The evaluation is based on predefined conditions.  
:::: info Examples

- “High risk present for the specialist object”
- “Process activity is on the positive list”

::::

### Difference: Decision vs. inspection vs. rule

-  **Rule**: Represents a single condition that is applied to specialist objects. Rules are part of a decision and determine the result based on their conditions.  
- **Decision**: Combines several rules to evaluate a specialist object and determine a final result. The user is shown transparently which rule was decisive for the decision.  
-  **Inspection**: Provides the user with hints or suggestions for correction and can contain a **suggestion** to make a direct adjustment. Relies on Decisions for this.
These concepts work together to provide a powerful framework for evaluating and enforcing conditions on specialized objects within the domain.
::: info Example

![Decision-Inspection-Rule]( /assets/en/object-model/inspections-decisions.png)

1. the *Decision* indicates that the DSFA is required because the *Rule* “High risk present” applies.
2. the *Inspection* states that a DPIA is required according to the decision (see above), but has not yet been carried out. It offers a *suggestion* to add the DPIA.
3. the user can trigger the *suggestion* by clicking to add the DSFA directly.

### Domain templates

![domain-templates]( /assets/en/object-model/domain-templates.png)
The domains are offered for use as **domain templates** in a repository. The domain templates are versioned. Depending on requirements, a customer can select one or more templates. If a customer selects a template in a specific version, a copy of the template is created for the customer. This exclusive copy of the customer is the domain with which the customer works. The customer's domain can be individually adapted to his needs.
::: info Example
![domain-templates-clients]( /assets/en/object-model/domain-templates-clients.png)
The diagram shows the verinice repository with the domain templates. The “IT-Grundschutz” and “DS-GVO” templates are each available in 2 different versions.

- **Customer A** uses the template “IT-Grundschutz V1.1”. The customer has customized his domain and created his own profile that is used as a special template for departments in the company.
- **Customer B** uses the templates “IT-Grundschutz V1.0” and “DS-GVO V1.5”. The customer has customized aspects and links of the objects in the “IT-Grundschutz” domain for his purposes.
- **Customer C** uses the unmodified template “DS-GVO V1.0”. He has not yet updated to the newer template version.
- **Customer D** uses the template “ISO&nbsp;27000” and has not yet made any changes to the domain.
