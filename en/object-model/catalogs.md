# Catalogs

Catalogs are a central aspect of the object model.
Each domain has a catalog that provides different objects. In the IT-Grundschutz domain, for example, these are information networks, building blocks (including families and layers), requirements and elementary threats:
![Catalog IT-Grundschutz Compendium](  /assets/en/object-model/catalog_model.de.png)
The individual catalog elements contain **references**(links) to other catalog elements.
When catalog elements are applied, the respective objects, including all references, are copied to the active unit and can be further edited there.
