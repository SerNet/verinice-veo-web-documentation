# Profiles

Profiles are based on catalogs; in addition to sample objects, they often contain catalog elements that have already been applied.
The application of a profile to a unit accordingly creates a large number of objects including catalog elements. This means that entire sample organizations, IT-Grundschutz profiles or similar can be loaded for further processing.
